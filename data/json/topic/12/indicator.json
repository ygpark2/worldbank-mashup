Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.","sourceOrganization":"United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Handbook of Statistics and data files, and International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics.","topics":[{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"},{"id":"21","value":"Trade"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.FOOD.ZS.UN","name":"Food exports (% of merchandise exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Food comprises the commodities in SITC sections 0 (food and live animals), 1 (beverages and tobacco), and 4 (animal and vegetable oils and fats) and SITC division 22 (oil seeds, oil nuts, and oil kernels).","sourceOrganization":"World Bank staff estimates from the Comtrade database maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.","topics":[{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"},{"id":"21","value":"Trade"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.FUEL.ZS.UN","name":"Fuel exports (% of merchandise exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Fuels comprise SITC section 3 (mineral fuels).","sourceOrganization":"World Bank staff estimates from the Comtrade database maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.","topics":[{"id":"21","value":"Trade"},{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.INSF.ZS.WT","name":"Insurance and financial services (% of commercial service exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Insurance and financial services cover freight insurance on goods exported and other direct insurance such as life insurance; financial intermediation services such as commissions, foreign exchange transactions, and brokerage services; and auxiliary services such as financial market operational and regulatory services.","sourceOrganization":"International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and data files.","topics":[{"id":"21","value":"Trade"},{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.MANF.ZS.UN","name":"Manufactures exports (% of merchandise exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Manufactures comprise commodities in SITC sections 5 (chemicals), 6 (basic manufactures), 7 (machinery and transport equipment), and 8 (miscellaneous manufactured goods), excluding division 68 (non-ferrous metals).","sourceOrganization":"World Bank staff estimates from the Comtrade database maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.","topics":[{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"},{"id":"21","value":"Trade"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.MMTL.ZS.UN","name":"Ores and metals exports (% of merchandise exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Ores and metals comprise the commodities in SITC sections 27 (crude fertilizer, minerals nes); 28 (metalliferous ores, scrap); and 68 (non-ferrous metals).","sourceOrganization":"World Bank staff estimates from the Comtrade database maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.","topics":[{"id":"21","value":"Trade"},{"id":"12","value":"Private Sector"}]},{"id":"TX.VAL.MRCH.AL.ZS","name":"Merchandise exports to economies in the Arab World (% of total merchandise exports)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Merchandise exports to economies in the Arab World are the sum of merchandise exports by the reporting economy to economies in the Arab World.
