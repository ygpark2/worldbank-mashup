the executive can be held accountable for its use of funds and for the results of its actions by the electorate and by the legislature and judiciary, and the extent to which public employees within the executive are required to account for administrative decisions, use of resources, and results obtained. The three main dimensions assessed here are the accountability of the executive to oversight institutions and of public employees for their performance, access of civil society to information on public affairs, and state capture by narrow vested interests.","sourceOrganization":"World Bank Group, CPIA database (http:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/ida).","topics":[{"id":"13","value":"Public Sector "}]},{"id":"IQ.SCI.MTHD","name":"Methodology assessment of statistical capacity (scale 0 - 100)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Statistical methodology indicator measures a country’s ability to adhere to internationally recommended standards and methods.

It is based on a diagnostic framework developed with a view to assessing the capacity of national statistical systems and monitoring progress in statistical development over time. The framework has three dimensions: statistical methodology; source data; and periodicity and timeliness. For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 indicates that the country meets all the criteria.","sourceOrganization":"World Bank, Bulletin Board on Statistical Capacity (http:\/\/bbsc.worldbank.org).","topics":[{"id":"13","value":"Public Sector "}]},{"id":"IQ.SCI.PRDC","name":"Periodicity and timeliness assessment of statistical capacity (scale 0 - 100)","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"Periodicity and timeliness indicator looks at the availability and periodicity of key socioeconomic indicators.
